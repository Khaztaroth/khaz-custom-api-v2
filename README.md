Here live the small tools I use to create custom commands for my twitch bot from external data, or with logic that can't be implemented natively in the bot. 

Currently  it has a weather endpoint that censors my hometown's name, and a hydration calculator that takes uptime data from DecAPI and measures how much water you should've drank.
